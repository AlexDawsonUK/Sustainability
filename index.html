				<h2 class="head">About</h2>
				<h3 class="region">Website</h3>
				<p class="txt">This website is primarily focused around the subject of Web sustainability. It's an emerging field and there's loads about sustainability that we just don't know about yet; so if you're looking to specialize, or if you're interested in launching some sort of open source project, or start a research study, or another endeavor that might be of interest to the community, please dive in (and let me know as I'm always interested in passing on the word of great new stuff).</p>
				<p class="txt">From the amount of carbon you utilize (amongst other resources) in developing a website (solo or as part of a business), to getting it hosted online, to sending that data down the tube, to it being rendered by the web browser on a device (which had to be manufactured), to read by a visitor (who will have carbon emissions of their own); the journey to being carbon neutral isn't an easy one, nor is it simple to map out. But sustainability is about small steps, making progress and nudges in the right direction as we make the world cleaner and greener.</p>

				<p class="txt">Alexander Dawson is an experienced Web Developer who initially came from a background in inclusive design. From promoting best practices in front-end development and upholding the best interests of those who may struggle to access Websites or apps, his attention soon got turned to the climate crisis upon recognising that this issue would ultimately impact at-risk groups (such as those with accessibility issues) severely. With a duel focus actively promoting Sustainability and Accessibility, he hopes to push the Internet to become ever more inclusive.</p>

				<p class="txt">If you're a Web Developer or Designer looking to change the world (for the better), look no further. This website has been explicitly created as a resource to host the research, content, and tools I produce with a specific subject in mind - Web Sustainability. The Internet is a huge emitter of carbon, and as the curators of all things digital, we have a responsibility to reduce our impact online (in order to help save the planet offline). Small changes matter so feel free to join the climate challenge, and I hope my resources are of use to you on your journey.</p>
				<p class="txt">If you believe that you can help make the Internet more sustainable, please join our friendly <a class="url" href="https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/">W3C Community Group</a> as we're working to produce sustainability guidelines for the Web!</p>
